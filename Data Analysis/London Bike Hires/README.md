**Evaluating the Perfomance for a London Bikes Company during and after COVID 19**


Project Brief
The Purpose of this project was to evaluate the performance of London Bikes Company and analyze the effects had, if any, during and after COVID 19 for the busiest season, June to September. Executives at this company are interested in reviewing the company's performance to see if/how COVID19 affected the company for the five most popular trip origin stations/locations. 


To meet their demands, I decided to build a comprehensive, interactive dashboard to efficiently convey the required information.

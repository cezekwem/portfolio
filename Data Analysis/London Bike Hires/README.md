**Evaluating the Perfomance for a London Bikes Company during and after COVID 19**

**PROJECT BRIEF**

The purpose of this project was to evaluate the performance of London Bikes Company and analyze the effects had, if any, during and after COVID 19 for the busiest season, June to September. Executives at this company are interested in reviewing the company's performance to see if/how COVID19 affected the company for the five most popular trip origin stations/locations. 

To meet their demands, I decided to build a comprehensive, interactive dashboard to efficiently convey the required information.


**DATA COLLECTION**

For this project, data was collected from the Big Query Public Datasets, which stores information about the bike brands, start and end station names, trip duration etc. (see database scheme below)

**DATA ANALYSIS & VISUALIZATION**

After importing the data into Excel, i uploaded the dataset to Tableau and went ahead to create the dashboard there.

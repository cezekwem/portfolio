**CHIUGO'S Data Portfolio

Hello, and welcome to my data portfolio!

My name is Chiugo and I have 4 years of Financial Operations experience. I had always been interested in data analytics but recently began my data journey in 2022 and I really enjoy automating systems to improve their effectiveness and efficiency.
Originally a self-taught analyst but currently finished 📶 Correlation One's Data Science for All fellowship with SQL, Tableau and Python.

Skillset includes:
▪️Database manipulation
▪️Data analysis lifecycle management
▪️Python (pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, Seaborn, SciPy, Pingouin)
▪️SQL
▪️Data visualization using Excel and Python libraries (Seaborn, Geopandas, Folium, Matplotlib)
▪️Exploratory data exploration
▪️Statistical analysis

Having worked in a high-growth tech startup, I excel in high-pressure environments, and I am keen to take on complex problems and time-sensitive assignments.

Today, I focus my data analytics and programming schools on solving any problem that comes my way. I'm always open to collaborate and learn from others, and can be reached professionally via E-mail and LinkedIn.

Have fun looking though these projects!

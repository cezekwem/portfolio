**CHIUGO'S Data Portfolio**

Hello, and welcome to my data portfolio!

My name is Chiugo and I'm really excited to display these analysis that I have been working on for the past few months. 
Although I have 4 years of Finance Operations experience, data has been something that I really fell into at my previous role. I love automating systems to improve their effectiveness and efficiency, conducting analysis that generate insights to ameliorate business performance and just having fun figuring out topics I'm interested/curious about using data.

I just finished a fellowship with Correlation One's Data Science for All Fellowship further expanding my knowledge in SQL, Tableau, and Python. 

Skillset includes:

▪️Database manipulation

▪️Data analysis lifecycle management

▪️Python (pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, Seaborn, SciPy, Pingouin)

▪️SQL

▪️Data visualization using Excel and Python libraries (Seaborn, Geopandas, Folium, Matplotlib)

▪️Exploratory data exploration

▪️Statistical analysis

I'm excited to use this space to further display my work and show growth as I continue to solve problems that come my way. I hope you are blessed by this!  I'm always open to collaborate and learn from others, and can be reached professionally via E-mail and LinkedIn.

Have fun looking though these projects (I KNOW I DID!)

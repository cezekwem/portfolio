**An In - Depth Look on How Food Deserts Affect Minority Communities in Louisiana**

This folder contains the work my team and I completed in fulfillment of our DS4A Fellowship. For our capstone project, we chose to delve deeper into Food insecurity particularly as it applies to underprivileged minorities living in food deserts. Some of the social variables being considered include racial segregation, access to public transportation, employment, and income.

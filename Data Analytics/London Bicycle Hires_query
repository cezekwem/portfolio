/*
This dataset was found in Bigquery Public Datasets which had been collected since 2015 and as a result contained 82 million rows. For my analysis, considering the space available, I decided to focus solely on the data before and after COVID 19 for the busiest season in the year (June - September) Since I'm working in Big query, I created a view of the required data and exported the data manually to a csv file. 
This file will be loaded in MS Excel for further inspection and data cleaning (if required) and data analysis.
If I was working from the SQL Server Database, I could automatically link my database to Excel.
Note that this method also ensures that the data is automatically updated and is generally preferred.
